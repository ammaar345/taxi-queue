# taxi-queue
This app is meant to populate a pie chart , for each time a passenger books a seat . Once the max passenger limit is reached(15) , the passenger count will reset.
Missing functionality , is that it should add into a database as well as create a graph based on the data that is based on how frequently taxis are used in specific areas.
